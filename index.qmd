## **Hola!!**

This webpage is done with the objective of advertise myself for companies and individuals to make me more hirable --- or at least appealing. Think of it as a second résumé; however I would add the prefix *anti*-résumé because I also seek feedback, discussion, community to get better in my professional career.

I am really interested in the world of modelling, biotech, engineering, technology, industry, and in a way philosophy (the fact of doing a mathematical model has many implications about reality itself). I'll be posting about these topics.
